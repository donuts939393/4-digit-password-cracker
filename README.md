# 4-digit-password-cracker
Created by my teacher,
this code allows a user to put their cursor in a text box and start to brute force 4 digit numbers in numerical order.
Also, this code is not intended to hack someone. Nor does it have the ability to.
If you don't already, you must download pyautogui to run the code. Here is the command: sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
